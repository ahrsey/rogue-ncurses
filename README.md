# BUGS

- BUG `astar` doesn't always connect rooms, this seems to be because I'm not
  calculating the algorithm correclty in the opposite direction, I'm thinking
  to maybe try a different algorithm to create more interesting connections,
  but for now as long as the rooms are generated towards the right things work

- BUG `astar` doesn't print at all, will probably just redo all of this part
